GridSpice is a cloud-based simulation package for the smartgrid.   In addition to combining several open source projects in a single easy-to-use package, GridSpice includes a number of new simulation features for demand response.  GridSpice is being developed iteratively with an ultimate goal of modeling the interactions between all parts of the electrical networkâ€“including generation, transmission, distribution, storage and loads.  Currently, GridSpice includes the ability to perform distribution simulations along with one-shot optimal power flow simulations.

The GridSpice team is currently working to add support for wholesale and retail electricity markets, and response of consumers to price sensitive contracts. We expect that GridSpice will serve as a useful, easy-to-use tool for industry practitioners, regulators, and researchers to forecast and improve system efficiency and reliability, maximize ROI on new technologies, reduce costs for all constituents, and introduce more effective pricing models. We also plan to investigate algorithms and techniques for electric vehicle infrastructure planning, utility scale storage, and home area appliance control.
